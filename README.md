#ANONCHAT

A very simple Omegle clone that is written using NodeJS, VueJS, Express and Socket.io
This is an experimental project for learning purposes.

This application uses nodeJS as the web server. Express web development framework to handle requests and serve the web pages.
Socket.io is used to handle real time chat, and VueJS for the user interface.

The design is straight out of 1980s, i'm not into designing and i'm bad at it. 
This was a learning experiment to understand web sockets and how to implement them. Not much priority has been placed on efficiency as the expected traffic is little to none. 

Used nginx as reverse proxy server to nodejs in development and in production(for the short while that it was live)
